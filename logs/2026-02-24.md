## What I Worked On
- Refactored authentication logic
- Fixed Supabase RLS policy bug
- Improved loading state in dashboard

## Challenges
- Real-time subscriptions caused unnecessary re-renders

## Solution
Memoized data fetch and separated state logic.

## What I Learned
Supabase real-time can trigger excessive updates if not scoped correctly.

## Tomorrow
- Implement question difficulty tagging
